          <p class="lead">Established in 1978, Go is the most widely distributed range of travel accessories in the world. It still remains a UK family business and it is just as committed to bring innovative products to market as it was over 30 years ago.

What is not commonly known is that the company pioneered the concept of a co-ordinated range of travel accessories. Its success has spawned an entire global industry which it still dominates to this very day.

In the beginning there were only 10 products in the range. Today the company has over 300 accessories all designed in-house by the team in London. The product range can be found in over 18,000 retail locations across the UK alone and is extensively distributed in over 70 countries around the world.

The product portfolio spans a wide variety of consumer needs and can be found not only in destination gateways such as airports and train stations, but also in department stores and pharmacies. It also has significant distribution with electrical specialists, kids, outdoor and gift retailers.          </p>
